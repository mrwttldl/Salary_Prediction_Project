 ## :file_folder:  Business Problem

This dataset was originally taken from the StatLib library at Carnegie Mellon University. The dataset is part of the data 
used in the 1988 ASA Graphics Section Poster Session.Salary data originally taken from Sports Illustrated, April 20, 1987.
1986 and career statistics are from the 1987 Baseball Encyclopedia Update, published by Collier Books, Macmillan Publishing Company, New York.

I want to develop a machine learning project to estimate the salaries of baseball players whose salary information and career statistics for 1986 are shared.
